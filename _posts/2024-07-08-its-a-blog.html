<p>This site will initially be used for documenting TryHackMe and HTB system walkthroughs as I complete them. While I have noted some ideas on further topics to cover, I am new to using GitHub, jekyll, and markdown.</p>

<p>My goal is to learn all the things while documenting the progress here.</p>
