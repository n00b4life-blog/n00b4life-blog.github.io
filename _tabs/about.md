<p>This website will serve as an initial platform for documenting my TryHackMe and HTB system walkthroughs as I complete them. </p>
<p>While I’ve jotted down some ideas for additional topics to cover, I’m relatively new to GitHub, Jekyll, and Markdown. Therefore, I’ll start by mastering the basics of these tools. </p>
<p>My goal is to learn all the things while documenting the progress here.</p>

<p>These days I spend most of my free time on TryHackMe</p>
